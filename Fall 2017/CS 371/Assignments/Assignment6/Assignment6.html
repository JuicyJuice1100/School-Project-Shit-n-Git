        <p>One day, distubing abosolutely no one, my favorite Tower
        of Hanoi was floating along a path on the ocean. Suddenly 
        out of nowhere, swinging on a parabolic arc came a 
        refractive sphereoid and in the other direction came 
  seemed to be a pyramid. The sphereoid crashed into the pyramid 
        causing an explosion sending bits and pieces flying everywhere.<p>
